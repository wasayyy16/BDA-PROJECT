PHASE 1:
This code is all about handling audio files. It's set up to read in audio files from a specific directory, analyze them to extract useful features, and then store those features along with related metadata in a MongoDB database. The code starts by establishing a connection to the database. It then clears out any existing data from the target collection to ensure a fresh start. Next, it loads metadata from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. The main loop iterates through the audio files, processing each one. For each file, it reads the audio, computes a certain type of feature called MFCC, applies a technique called PCA to reduce the feature dimensionality, standardizes the features, and stores them in the database along with relevant genre information. It handles any errors that pop up during this process and prints out error messages. Once all the audio files have been processed, the script closes the database connection. Essentially, it's a script for analyzing audio data and saving the results for future use.
PHASE 2:
This code snippet connects to a MongoDB database where audio features are stored. It then retrieves the MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features of a specific track from the database. After that, it iterates through all tracks in the database and calculates the cosine similarity between the MFCC features of the queried track and each track in the database. Tracks with a cosine similarity greater than 0.8 (adjustable threshold) are considered similar, excluding the queried track itself. The IDs of these similar tracks are stored in a list. Finally, the IDs of similar tracks are printed out. In summary, this script finds tracks similar to a given track based on their MFCC features stored in a MongoDB database and prints out their IDs.
PHASE 3:
In this phase we have generated the front end of a web page using html and connected it with our ML model using Flask. Our webpage runs songs and gives runtime insights on the recommended new songs to be played afterwards.
